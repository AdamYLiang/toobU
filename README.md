toobU is a YouTube clone that focuses on publicly uploading and sharing videos. Users with an account will have access to a number of features, some of which include creating channels and commenting on videos. 

## Technologies Used
toobU is built with Ruby on a Rails back end and with a React/Redux front end.

toobU uses Amazon Web Services to store videos and other data. 

## Main Features
**User Authentication** - Users can signup or login to accounts. In addition there is also a demo account to try out basic features.
**Channels and Videos** - Once logged in, users can create channels for others to view. Once users have channels, they are able to upload videos for others to see and comment on.
